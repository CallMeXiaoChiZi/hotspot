run_10kb_counts
---------------

1) Change grep command to include -w flag.  This is in response to
problems using purely numeric chromosome names (like 2, 20, 22), which
were not resolving uniquely.

2) Add --ec to bedmap call.  Without this, can lead to un-flagged
errors when using older versions of bedmap that can't accommodate
starch files, but will nevertheless run on them without error, but
producing bad results.  Tough to track done.

3) Add identifying echo statement.


Multiple files: run_10kb_counts, run_generate_random_lib, wavePeaks
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Change from using the "cut -fn" motif to the "awk '{print $n}'" motif,
especially when using the chromosome file.  This is to handle the case
where bed and/or chromosome files use spaces instead of tabs: the
default for cut is a single tab, whereas the default for awk is any
amount of whitespace.  

Without this change, and with spaces as the delimiter in the
chromosome file, I was running into the infamous xfm error from the
wavelets program:

modwt()
wavelet xfm exceeds sample size
